🚀 Simple Linear Regression Model for Salary Prediction 📊
Welcome to my Machine Learning project where I implemented a Simple Linear Regression Model to predict salaries based on years of experience. This project is a great introduction to understanding regression in machine learning and offers practical insights into model building, training, evaluation, and data visualization.

📁 Project Overview
In this task, the objective was to:

Build a Linear Regression model using a small dataset with two columns: Years of Experience and Salary.
Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot to demonstrate the model's prediction accuracy.
🛠️ Project Workflow
Dataset Creation:

A dataset was created with Years of Experience as the feature and Salary as the target variable.
The dataset consists of 10 data points.
Model Building:

The model was developed using scikit-learn’s Linear Regression algorithm.
Data was split into training and testing sets for better evaluation.
Model Training and Prediction:

The model was trained on 80% of the data, and predictions were made on the remaining 20%.
Model Evaluation:

The performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score, which helped in understanding the model's fit.
Data Visualization:

A regression line was plotted on a scatter plot to visually assess how well the model fits the data.
📊 Project Results
Mean Squared Error (MSE): A metric used to evaluate the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
R² Score: A statistical measure representing the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable explained by the independent variable. A score closer to 1 represents a better model fit.
🔥 Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Data was split into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization.
Model Training: Utilized the popular Linear Regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive analysis using MSE and R² metrics to evaluate model performance.
Data Visualization: A beautiful plot of the regression line over data points.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning
matplotlib for data visualization
