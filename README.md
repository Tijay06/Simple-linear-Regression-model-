<h1>🚀 Simple Linear Regression Model for Salary Prediction 📊</h1>

<p>
Welcome to my Machine Learning project where I implemented a Simple Linear Regression Model to predict salaries based on years of experience. This project is a great introduction to understanding regression in machine learning and offers practical insights into model building, training, evaluation, and data visualization.
</p>

<h3>📁 Project Overview</h3>
<caption>In this task, the objective was to:</caption>
<ol>
<li>Build a Linear Regression model using a small dataset with two columns: Years of Experience and Salary.</li>
<li>Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.</li>
<li>Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot to demonstrate the model's prediction accuracy.</li>
</ol>

<h3>🛠️ Project Workflow</h3>
<caption>Dataset Creation:</caption>

<p>
A dataset was created with Years of Experience as the feature and Salary as the target variable.
The dataset consists of 10 data points.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Model Building:</li>
<p>The model was developed using scikit-learn’s Linear Regression algorithm.</p>
<p>Data was split into training and testing sets for better evaluation.</p>

<li>Model Training and Prediction:</li>
<p>The model was trained on 80% of the data, and predictions were made on the remaining 20%.</p>

<li>Model Evaluation:</li>
<p>The performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score, which helped in understanding the model's fit.</p>

<li>Data Visualization:</li>
<p>A regression line was plotted on a scatter plot to visually assess how well the model fits the data.</p>
</ol>

<h3>📊 Project Results</h3>
<p>
<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE): A metric used to evaluate the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.</li>
<li>R² Score: A statistical measure representing the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable explained by the independent variable. A score closer to 1 represents a better model fit.</li>
</p>

<h3>🔥 Key Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Data was split into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization.</li>
<li>Model Training: Utilized the popular Linear Regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation: Comprehensive analysis using MSE and R² metrics to evaluate model performance.</li>
<li>Data Visualization: A beautiful plot of the regression line over data points.</li>
</ol>
